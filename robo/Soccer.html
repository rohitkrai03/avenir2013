		<h2><a name="what" id="what">Problem Statment</a></h2>
		<p class="post_para" >Design a manually controlled mechanical bot, which can push or kick a medium sized plastic ball. The prime motive of this game is to push or kick the ball in opponent's goalpost and avoid the ball from going into yours.<br/>The bot with more goals(point) will win the game.</p>

					<li>> They must all be present students of an engineering institution. They may or may not be from the same institute.</li>
	
					<li>> No participant can be a member of two teams. No two teams can share the same robot. </li>
	
					<li>> The event co-ordinator is free to make any change to the above rules at any time. Any such change will be duly notified to the participants as and when required. The decision of the event coordinator will be final and binding.</li>

					<ul>
					<li>> Team members will not be allowed to touch any part of arena, only organizer are allowed to

					<li>> If a bot becomes immobile it will be disqualified.</li>
					<li>> Damaging the arena will lead to disqualification.</li>
					
					
					</ul>
					</br>
					<h2>Game Overview:</h2>
					<ul>
					<li>> Game will be played with light plastic or polymer balls with size similar to golf ball. </li>
					<li>> Bots can move in any part of the arena.</li>
					<li>> In case the bot scores a goal or ball leaves the arena, ball will be awarded to opposing bot.</li>
					<li>> The game will then restart from within starting range.</li>
					<li>> Only first start will be from centre in which rear edge of both bots should touch the goal line, till the start of the game.</li>
					<li>> Side will be decided by toss.in alternate way it will cahnge.</li>
					<li>> Ball start will always be by a bump or kick not by moving or dragging the ball.</li>

					<li>> In case of ball halts(more than 10 seconds) which does not involve mistake of any participant, the game will restart from the nearest ‘PointStart’ marked on the arena as shown in the arena map.</li>
					<li>> Also, both bots will be placed equal distance apart from the 'PointStart.</li>

					<h3>Specification:</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>> No bot can measure more than 25*25*25 centimetres in length and breadth however there is no restriction on how to control bot or how to kick the ball.</li>
					<li>> Participants can use any method to hit the ball. Shear bump is as good as a power kick. </li>
					
					
					</ul>
					 
					 
					<!--<ol>
					<li>> Dimensions of the robot should not exceed 25cm X 25cm X 25cm.</li>
	
					<li>> The robot can use on-board or external power supply.</li>
	
					<li>> The Voltage anywhere in the circuit should not exceed 230V AC, however 220V 50Hz AC supply will be provided to all participants in form of standard 3-pin sockets on extension boards. Any other form of electrical power required (DC battery power for example) will have to produce by the participants themselves. </li>
	
					<li>> The robot cannot be constructed using readymade Lego kits or any readymade mechanisms. But can use readymade gear assemblies.</li>
	
					<li>> Robot can be wired or wireless controlled but AVENIR 2012 will not be responsible for any interference caused. In case of wired, the wire should remain slack throughout the game.</li>
